# Robo-Advisor
### Project implements ACB reporting for ETFs where it calculates ACB, Share Balance, and ACB/Share for both Buy and Sell Transactions. When the user sells their shares, the CGL will also be calculated. Transaction history is also sorted by trade date. After the program makes all the calculates and has sorted the transactions, it will output all the transaction entries to the console.

### For more information about the project, please check out the project instructions which I have also added to this project repository under the "Documentation" folder.
