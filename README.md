# Robo-Advisor
### Project implements ACB reporting for ETFs where it calculates ACB, Share Balance, and ACB/Share for both Buy and Sell transactions. When the user sells their shares, the CGL will also be calculated. Transaction history is sorted by trade date. After the program makes all the calculations and has sorted the transactions, it will output all the transaction entries made by the user to the console/terminal. Project files can be accessed under the "Robo-Advisor ACB for ETFs Project" folder within this repository. 

### For more information about the project, please check out the project instructions file which I have also uploaded to this project repository under the "Documentation" folder. 

#### Please note that this project was done during ECE 150 - "Fundamentals of Programming", a course offered by the University of Waterloo's ECE Department which was instructed by Prof. Douglas Wilhelm Harder and Prof. Hiren Patel. Lab instructor and supervisor for this course was David Lau.
